# Starter-kit-java

Java starter kit for the glo2003 laboratory at Ulaval.

Built with [spark](http://sparkjava.com/) framework for simplicity

Starting at java is not easy: [better-java](ttps://github.com/cxxr/better-java) gives you modern best practices.

Some nice libraries have been added to help you start and do things way faster and more easily. Have a look at them
in the [build.gradle](/build.gradle) file.

```bash
./gradlew build
```

./gradlew run
```
